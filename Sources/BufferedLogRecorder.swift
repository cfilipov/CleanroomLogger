/**
 The `BufferedLogRecorder` is a generic `LogRecorder` that buffers the log
 messages passed to its `record()` function.
 
 Construction requires a `createBufferItem` function, which is responsible
 for converting the `LogEntry` and formatted message `String` into the
 generic `BufferItem` type.
 
 Three specific subclasses are also provided which will buffer a different
 `BufferItem` type for each call to `record()`:
 
 - `BufferedMessageRecorder` stores `String`s containing the formatted log
 message.
 - `BufferedLogEntryRecorder` stores the `LogEntry` values passed to `record()`.
 - `BufferedLogEntryMessageRecorder` stores a `(LogEntry, String)` tuple
 containing the `LogEntry` and formatted log message.
